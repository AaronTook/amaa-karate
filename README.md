# AMAA Karate
A custom design for the American Martial Arts Academy website.

This is a website hosted on Github pages (https://aarontook.github.io/amaa-karate/home.html) that I made. 
It is an updated and edited version of the American Martial Arts Academy (of which I am a part) website. The original site can be found at http://www.amaakarate.com/.

All HTML and CSS files were made by AaronTook. image and pdf files were taken from the current AMAA website.

If you find an issue with the site, please let me know and I will do my best to resolve it. Thank you!
